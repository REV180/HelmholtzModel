# HelmholtzModel
Model of HH-coil pair, displaying field strength and direction.
Code to demonstrate a pair of square Helmholtz coils generating a magnetic field.
The HH coil configuration does not produce zero field strength at the
centre, but rather a volume of uniform field strength and direction (Grad(B) is small, approaching zero).
Anti-Helmholtz pair can be generated by reversing the current in one of the
coils.
Each coil is formed of four straight wires, each wire represented by 100
points. Field is evaluated at 19 points on each axis inside the volume of
interest.
Script is based on ideas found at various free sources found online, but
the construction was my own work.
